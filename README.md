# Note Taker

## Description
There are many benefits to using a note-taker application: it encourages staying focused, being on time, and helping get organized; notes serve as reminders.  This note-taker app accomplishes all of the above.  The front end for this application was provided.  The back-end was built using node.js and express.js, a fast and minimal framework, hence the name.  It quickly sets up a server and handles the routes between client requests and the endpoints.  With the app completed, it was uploaded to GitHub and deployed to Heroku, which supports the data being stored in a “sort of database,” in this case the data is stored in a JSON file.  When you visit the app, you can create a note, and the messages are listed on the leftside and viewable when clicked.
